Projects
The Interdependency of Policy, People, and COVID-19
STEM BIG DATA CHALLENGE COMPETITION
• Analysed the relationship between government stringency, population movement, and the onset of new cases of COVID-19
• Implemented cross correlation-based statistical analyses to investigate potential causal relationships
• Abstract released in STEM Fellowship Journal

eProtect: Protecting Organic Electronics from Moisture
CAPSTONE DESIGN PROJECT
• Designed, fabricated, and validated a multilayer polymeric nanocoating that protect organic electronics from moisture induced degradation
• Researched market needs for waterproofing tech and converted these needs to specific quantitative requirements which were used to facilitate design
• Technology was specifically designed with scalability in mind; team conducted analytical fluid dynamics studies to ensure that the coating could be successfully administered in a large-scale fashion(i.e. industrial spray-coating) contexts
• Raised additional research funds through the competitive grants and pitch presentations (Engineer of the Future Fund recipient, Quantum Valley Problem Pitch Finalist)

Methanol Synthesis using Solar PV and Carbon Capture
TU DELFT ME45180: ENERGY STORAGE
• Proposed a renewably-sourced feedstock plant near a factory to capture and use emitted carbon dioxide for methanol synthesis in a report and a technical presentation
• Determined mass and energy flows for the facility and estimated CAPEX and OPEX to investigate feasibility
